Let’s say you are a beginning meditator. You sit down on the mat, close your eyes, focus on your breath, and chances are these two things happen:

You realize that your brain is constantly swimming in thoughts and distractions.
After trying in vain to quiet these thoughts and ‘do nothing’, you get frustrated, irate, and impatient. After a certain point, you just can’t wait for the meditation session to be over.

Why? And how does it relate to marketing? Let’s break it out.

So the first thing that happens is you notice that your brain is constantly preoccupied with thoughts.

These thoughts usually consist of:
Problems we’re trying to solve
Stresses about our day
Regrets or anxieties
Dreams about the future
Reveries about the past

Notice these thoughts all fit into two categories: things we perceive as good or bad. But real life has three main categories of stimuli; good, bad, and neutral.

So why aren’t our brains full of neutral stimuli, then?

Easy.

Our brains are our natural spam filters.

And thank goodness they are! We’re bombarded by so many different stimuli each day, that our brain has to create ‘shortcuts’ to help us not overwhelm our attention. I once read that the brain filters out 99% of the stimuli it gets fed every single day.

There are only two buckets that make it through: good and bad. The more you want something to stand out, the more REALLY good or REALLY bad it needs to be.

So from a marketing perspective, how do you make a product stand out in someone’s mind? Make it REALLY good, aka make it something novel, that the person has encountered before, or that helps them in a hugely measurable way. You can also make your product solve a really BAD problem, a problem that is causing them to stay up at night or is causing them constant stress or worry.

Don’t forget, when anyone visits your site or hears about your product, they too will be putting it through their spam filter. Now you know how to start getting into their heads.


Which brings us to the second thing a beginning meditator encounters. A tenant of meditation is non-striving, or being ‘productive’ by not being productive at all. 

For a beginner, this can be almost impossible. This is because almost everything we humans do is for a purpose. We are always striving to get something or somewhere. 


After trying in vain to quiet these thoughts and ‘do nothing’, you get frustrated, irate, and impatient. After a certain point, you just can’t wait for the meditation session to be over.
