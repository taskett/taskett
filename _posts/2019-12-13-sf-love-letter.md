### San Francisco in two words: 

Sunshine, fog, hills, bay, glitter, center of the universe, change, growth, happening, movement, ambition, possibility

Zombies everywhere, filth on the streets, broken car windows, dodging needles on sidewalks

Everyone trying to make their unique mark on the world… all wearing the exact same uniform. That kind of outfit that says, “I make more money than God, so I’ll dress like I shop at Walmart.”

The look on their faces that says, “Fuck you, I’m more important.”

Intelligence, cunning, games of strategy, handshakes and veneered smiles. A Slytherin’s paradise.

History, four generations born here, grandma’s house here, family businesses owned here. Feels more like home than my current base does.

It’s It, See’s Candy, succulents, brown (ahem, golden) hills, blue water, clear skies, the feeling that California has of that beautiful devil whispering into your ear seductively at night, beckoning you to stay, asking you to stay, telling you that _you must stay or you will be nothing._

Chinatown, that one dumpling joint with the roaches on the walls, the place where my Mom and Step Dad had their first date. 

“It’s by the Chinese playground- you can’t miss it” my Mom tells me on the phone.

This is that playground now.

All the Uber drivers tell me the city is haunted… and everywhere I go I see ghosts of a city that’s been gone for a long time now.

Conferences everywhere, so many fucking conferences, does San Franscisco consist mainly of conferences and coding schools?

Watching the sun set over the ocean on Strawberry hill, not a cloud in the sky, everyone claps as the sun goes below the sea. The scent of flowers fills the air. A canadian goose follows me around shyly, looking away when I look back at it. Lemons growing on trees and fresh tomatoes from the neighbor’s garden.

Charming little holes in the wall with smells and tastes and dreams. Laughing gay men. Glorious beards. The best bun rieu I’ve had outside of Vietnam.

### Magical shithole.

Man, I think I want to move here.

The devil breathes into my ear, _‘Do it.’_
