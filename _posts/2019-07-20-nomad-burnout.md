Over the past year, I’ve seen a burnout epidemic among digital nomads. 
> “I’ve been pretty tired for some time now”

> “I was really burned out, but I’m better now, but not really”

> “I can’t focus and I don’t know what to do about it”

I’m also a nomad who has been burned out for a long time. Since last November, I haven’t written a single article. My personal website was down for over 8 months and I didn’t have the energy to fix it until this week.

Only now am I starting to function normally again. 


So why now? **I took a break from long-term travel and went home for a while.**

Every day that I surround myself with the same boring, easy environment, my brain fog lifts a little more.

Turns out, there’s a neurological explanation for why going home helped me so much, and I’ll cover it here.

### How Serial Travel Affects Our Awareness

According to the book, [The Mind Illuminated](https://www.amazon.com/Mind-Illuminated-Meditation-Integrating-Mindfulness-ebook/dp/B01INMZKAQ/), our conscious experience consists of two areas: **attention and peripheral awareness.**

Attention is what we choose to hone in on. Whatever we pay attention to is our main focus. At the same time we can also be aware of what’s going on around us and in the background, which is our peripheral awareness.

Attention’s main job is to hone in on specific things, either in our minds or outside of us, so we can analyze and interpret them. Peripheral awareness allows us to respond better by giving us more awareness of a bigger context. **Attention is under our direct control, but our peripheral awareness is not.**

When we’re in a healthy state of mind, attention and peripheral awareness work together to make sure we’re always mindful of the situations we are in, and that we’re responding to them effectively.

However, when we travel for long periods of time, this balance can get thrown off and can cause a negative feedback loop which traps us in ever increasing states of burnout.

This is based on a concept called **awareness deficit disorder.** 

When we travel to foreign locales, our peripheral awareness gets bombarded by new sights, smells, languages, weather conditions, geographical points, and more. Even a simple trip to the grocery store introduces us to thousands of new stimuli, many of which we may have never encountered before in our lives.

Remember from earlier that while we can control what we pay attention to, we don’t have direct control over what appears in our peripheral awareness. This causes us to overuse our attention because it is what’s under our direct control. We try to take everything in, to process and make sense of it all, and it overwhelms us. 

This can cause a nasty spiral, where we become less overall aware of situations because we overuse our attention, but to compensate, we use our attention even more, thus utilizing our peripheral awareness less, diminishing our overall awareness of situations, and so on and so forth. This leads us to not be able to take in as much overall information, to process it like we normally would, and leads to an inability to see things from a calm holistic state. Basically, when you try to pay attention to too many stimuli on a constant basis over a long period of time, it breaks your brain.

Another situation where we lose our ability to be mindful is whenever our attention shifts rapidly back and forth between different objects. It takes considerable brain power to attend to a bunch of different stimuli at once. 

#### There are three kinds of these distractions:

* Scanning: is when our mind scans our inner and outer surroundings for something of interest. While traveling, our mind is constantly scanning our surroundings for something new and exciting or foreign dangers we should avoid.

* Getting captured: this is when an outer or inner distraction, from an ambulance passing to a body spasm to a strange thought, disrupts our attention. This could happen from the joyful discovery that the garbage trucks in Taipei play classical music, to almost getting hit by an errant motorized merchant on the sidewalk.

* Alternating: When you ‘multitask’ and you think you’re doing two things at once, really your attention is just rapidly alternating from one thing to the other, but you think you are maintaining focus on both things. An example is talking to a friend while looking for a cafe while simultaneously avoiding huge cracks in the sidewalk somewhere like Canggu.

When we travel, traffic might come from the other side of the road, or we might be in a touristy area where hagglers are competing for our attention, or we could be somewhere unknown where we’re on extra guard for our safety. All of these factors drain us, and over time they add a friction to daily living that wears us down and depletes our capacity to function at optimal levels.

Emotional stress caused by travel also causes the same thing to happen, as we have so many internal worries and concerns that we lose the ability to step back and see the bigger picture.

All of these factors combine to allow long-term travel to contribute to chronic burnout.

What You Can Do About It

This isn’t to say that nomadism is inherently unhealthy or that you can’t travel without getting burned out. Plenty of people are able to sustain a nomadic lifestyle over the long term while also maintaining their sanity.

So how do they do it? I have a few specific options below, but the overall theme is that they add as much stability as possible to their living situations. 

They Slowmad.


Chances are, you are already aware of the concept of slowmading, where you stay in locations for 2-3 months or longer. In fact, from my observations, most nomads transition to this style of living after the first year of going nomadic.

The benefits: Keeping a stable routine will give your brain a sense of stability and normalcy, and could help you recover from burnout quicker.

They Visit Home or they Have a Home Base

Many nomads (give examples)

In fact, I’m looking for a homebase myself. If you have a suggestion, reach out!

The benefits:

They Visit the Same Places Every Year

The benefits: When you travel to the same places over and over, those places stop overwhelming you with new stimuli. You get used to them and they start to feel more like home than new destinations.

They Travel to places with low Friction of Daily Living

Auth0 (my employer)’s CEO was hosting an AMA when an Argentinian employee asked him most about what he missed about his home country of Argentina. He paused and then said, “While I will always love my country, my honest answer is that I do not miss it.” He then spoke about the political strife and danger growing up there, and how even after things calmed down, there was this friction to daily living that took up a lot of his brain space. When he moved to the Northwest United States, all of a sudden that friction went away and he was able to succeed at Microsoft and, later on, was able to found Auth0. 

Living in a place that is safe, clean, and peaceful can allow your mind to relax, enabling you to focus on solving bigger issues and make your mark on this world.

SUMMARY PARAGRAPH



As for me, I’m living the boring life for a while, to free my mind up to focus on more pressing problems- making things that help makers.
