I grabbed a bite to eat the other week with one of my favorite coworkers, [Shafiq Shivji](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shafiqshivji/ ), who is a former VC-backed startup founder. We discussed the best way to gain traction and move up at a company, what to do when you're feeling stuck at work, and the most important thing to have when you start your own business.

 I feverently took notes, and now I'm sharing his best career advice with you.

## Shafiq's best tips for success

#### Visibility is Everything

* Focus on being highly visible. Work on high-visibility projects (whether this is at your job or if you're doing personal branding or a side hustle), even better if you own/run those projects. You want people to know what _you_ are capable of.

* Take a step back and look at the key players in your industry who could impact your success the most. Who are they? Do they know who you are?

* **I don’t know a single person who made it to the top without being pulled up by someone else.**

* Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Plant seeds in many different places, and with many different people. Seek out the superstars and get to know them.

* If you're at a company, what can you work on that Senior Leadership will notice? Focus on those projects. 

* On that note, once a quarter, ask someone senior to groom your projects for those that are most impactful.


#### What to do when you feel Blocked

* **When you are feeling blocked in your projects, this is almost always a sign to take a step back and invest in yourself.** This could be listening to business podcasts or by talking to new people in your industry or starting a different kind of project. But when you’re blocked at work it’s _always_ a sign to work on yourself first. 

* At a company, if your specific team or manager is a dud, do what you have to, please the people you have to please, and then make all your other projects about making it outside of your team.

* If you have your own venture, focus on what works; spend more time maximizing what is already working and pull your attention away from iniatives that aren't bringing you ROI.

* No matter how bad your job or your situation is, there is always an opportunity to do something good in that company. Always an opportunity to shine and make a difference. Always!

* Is there something leadership does that you admire? You don’t need a title to act like that.

#### Mental Health and Work

* Don’t take your job too seriously! Heck, don't take anything in life too seriously. 

* If you're hard on yourself, try assuming it's not your fault. Seriously, if you're stressed about something that's not going perfectly at work, assume it’s someone or something else’s fault, and move forward. Don't sweat it. Don’t blame everything on yourself.

* **Know what to care about and what not to give a shit about.** Even if you have investors or customers or bosses pestering you to get certain things done, if it's not high-impact, don't treat it like it is. And when you have a high-impact iniative, make it your #1 priority. Do this long enough and you'll watch your career transform.

#### Starting a Company

* When you start a company, the #1 thing is to find something you are passionate about. Because it’s going to get really hard, and things are going to get really dark and bleak at some point, and you are going to need that to keep you going.

* Don’t know what to start a business doing? Start by making a list of things that you like! Search for that passion.

* And make deadlines. If you want to come up with an idea, make sure you have a due date. I'll give myself a due date for a problem that I have _no idea_ how to solve, and every single time, my brain comes up with a solution by the deadline.


In the two weeks since our chat, I've started implementing some of Shafiq's advice and I've **already seen an improvement** in how effective I am at my job (and I'm enjoying my work more too!)
