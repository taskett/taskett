2019 was a rough year. Let me explain.

You know your Uncle Bob, who got a heart attack at age 58 and he was completely shocked? **He kept repeating, “I’m so young, how could this happen to me?” and you just wanted to shake him and yell, “You eat fried chicken for breakfast and you haven’t exercised in 20 years! It’s obvious!”**

(Okay, you non-American readers, I get it- you all live balanced lifestyles and your uncle is healthy as a horse. Just stick with me here.)

In this situation, **I am Uncle Bob.** I spent the first half of the year blaming my unhappiness on everyone and everything around me, failing to notice that I was the source of most of my problems. I was in a dark place with my job, my lifestyle, my appearance, my relationship… you name it.

One night I was quora-ing what to do when you dislike your job, and one answer slapped me hard in the face. The poster said that his friends who like their jobs all have well-managed lives. Not only do they enjoy what they do for a living, but they have healthy marriages, well run homes, great friendships, the list goes on. He went on to say that if you’re not happy with your job, perhaps _you_ are the problem.

I was unhappy _everywhere_.

I realized that poor habits over many years got me to the sad state I was in. I started seeing a therapist, stopped the nomad life (for now), and got a home base in Seattle. I also took a long break from any side hustles or related projects, and focused my energies on stability and mental health.

It’s starting to show. I don’t know if I’m _happy_ yet, but I am not depressed or burned out anymore, so I’ll take it! Things at work have gone from night to day, and I don’t feel like the Earth is crumbling out from under my feet in my personal life anymore.

I've spent the last 6 months laying the ground work for a much, much better 2020. Bring it on!

## What’s in store for 2020?

In 2020, I want to give myself lots of room to breathe. To recover. To start over on a healthy foundation. So with that in mind, my main goals for 2020 are:

* **Simplify my Life**
    * cut out the majority of things, activities, and people who primarily drain me
* **Follow the Magic**
    * add more people, activities, and career moves that feel magical and _right_ in my core
* **Set a great Routine**
    * make sure all the healthy things in life are automated so that I don’t have to waste extra time trying to get my shit together, because it’s all on auto pilot.

And there you have it! I plan on renovating this site in January and adding an /open area where you'll be able to track key goals along with me in 2020. 

I also plan on getting more specific with my big goals as 2020 goes on. I'm still in 'recovery mode' so focusing on pursuing big goals is on the backburner while I continue to pursue stability and recovery. I am hoping in Q2 of 2020 I'll be able to focus on more 'sexy' goals, like increasing my MRR
