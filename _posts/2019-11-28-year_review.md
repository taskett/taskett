2019 was a rough year. Let me explain.

You know your Uncle Bob, who got a heart attack at age 58 and he was completely shocked? **He kept repeating, “I’m so young, how could this happen to me?” and you just wanted to shake him and yell, “You eat fried chicken for breakfast and you haven’t exercised in 20 years! It’s obvious!”**

(Okay, you non-American readers, I get it- you all live balanced lifestyles and your uncle is healthy as a horse. Just stick with me here.)

In this situation, **I am Uncle Bob.** I spent the first half of the year blaming my unhappiness on everyone and everything around me, failing to notice that I was the source of most of my problems. I was in a dark place with my job, my lifestyle, my appearance, my relationship… you name it.

One night I was quora-ing what to do when you dislike your job, and one answer slapped me hard in the face. The poster said that his friends who like their jobs all have well-managed lives. Not only do they enjoy what they do for a living, but they have healthy marriages, well run homes, great friendships, the list goes on. He went on to say that if you’re not happy with your job, perhaps _you_ are the problem.

I was unhappy _everywhere_.

I realized that poor habits over many years got me to the sad state I was in. I started seeing a therapist, stopped the nomad life (for now), and got a home base in Seattle. I also took a long break from any side hustles or related projects, and focused my energies on stability and mental health.

It’s starting to show. I don’t know if I’m _happy_ yet, but I am not depressed or burned out anymore, so I’ll take it! Things at work have gone from night to day, and I don’t feel like the Earth is crumbling out from under my feet in my personal life anymore.

I've spent the last 6 months laying the ground work for a much, much better 2020.

## What’s in store for 2020?

This year, I want to give myself lots of room to breathe. To recover. To start over on a healthy foundation. So with that in mind, my main goals for 2020 are:

* Simplify my Life
* Follow the Magic
* Set a great Routine

### Simplify My Life

This one's pretty straightforward. Cut out the majority of things, activities, and people who primarily drain me.

### Follow the Magic

Magic is that feeling of wonder, of goosebumps, excitement, of YES.

Magic is something that just lights you up. You undoubtedly know it when you feel it.

In 2020, I want hang out with more people who feel a little bit like magic. I want to consume more things/experiences that are magic. I only want to work on side projects that feel like magic. I only want to move my career in a direction that feels _right_ in my core.


## Set solid, Consistent Routine/Habits


*Confession:* I’ve never stuck to a real routine. I don’t think my brain likes organization or consistency. But I also think it’s an ‘Uncle Bob’ symptom that has led to a lot of energy being spent unnecessarily. **A routine = all the healthy things in life are automated so that you don’t have to waste extra time trying to get your shit together, because it’s all on auto pilot.**

At least, that’s what I hope, because as I just told you, I’ve never had a real routine before that I’ve stuck to!

This is my ideal routine. I don’t expect to actually nail all of these things, but, hey, shoot for the moon and you’ll land among the stars right?

Once I have a solid routine in place, then I can add travel and side projects back in, and have a good foundation for those things to rest upon.
