2019 was a rough year. Let me explain.

You know your Uncle Bob, who got a heart attack at age 58 and he was completely shocked? **He kept repeating, “I’m so young, how could this happen to me?” and you just wanted to shake him and yell, “You eat fried chicken for breakfast and you haven’t exercised in 20 years! It’s obvious!”**

(Okay, you non-American readers, I get it- you all live balanced lifestyles and your uncle is healthy as a horse. Just stick with me here.)

In this situation, **I am Uncle Bob.** I spent the first half of the year blaming my unhappiness on everyone and everything around me, failing to notice that I was the source of most of my problems. I was in a dark place with my job, my lifestyle, my appearance, my relationship… you name it.

One night I was quora-ing what to do when you dislike your job, and one answer slapped me hard in the face. The poster said that his friends who like their jobs all have well-managed lives. Not only do they enjoy what they do for a living, but they have healthy marriages, well run homes, great friendships, the list goes on. He went on to say that if you’re not happy with your job, perhaps you are the problem.

I realized I was unhappy everywhere. That was the day that things started to turn around.

I started seeing a therapist, stopped the nomad life (for now), and got a home base in Seattle. I also took a long break from any side hustles or related projects, and focused my energies on stability and mental health.

It’s starting to show. I don’t know if I’m happy yet, but I am not depressed or burned out anymore, so I’ll take it! Things at work have gone from night to day, and I don’t feel like the Earth is crumbling out from under my feet in my personal life anymore.








## What’s in store for 2020

Irrelevancy used to be my biggest fear. But now that I’m here and completely irrelevant, I’m okay with it. If that’s what it’s going to take for me to be okay with myself, then hell yeah! Bring it on.

I have some big things I really want to accomplish next year. But right now I’m not in the place to produce again, and I don’t know when I’ll give myself the green light to make things in the future. 


So with that in mind, **I only have two definite _‘will happen’_ goals for 2020. They are:**

* Follow the Magic (and cut out anything that isn’t magical)
* Set solid, Consistent Routine/Habits

First off, when was the last time you took a real vacation? For me, it was March of 2018. So in January, I’m going to go somewhere really boring (Arizona wooo!) and I’m so psyched to sit by a pool, have meals with my family, and hike a ton of mountains in the sunshine and warm weather for a couple of weeks.

After that...

### Follow the Magic

Magic is quality. Magic is that feeling of wonder, of goosebumps, excitement, of YES.

Magic is something that just lights you up. It’s hard to define, but you undoubtedly know it when you feel it.

In 2020, I want to cut out anything that isn’t magic. I only want to hang out with people who feel a little bit like magic. I only want to buy or consume things that are magic. I only want to work on side projects that feel like magic. I only want to move my career in a direction that feels wondrous.


## Set solid, Consistent Routine/Habits


*Confession:* I’ve never stuck to a real routine. I don’t think my brain likes organization or consistency. But I also think it’s an ‘Uncle Bob’ symptom that has led to a lot of energy being spent unnecessarily. **A routine = all the healthy things in life are automated so that you don’t have to waste extra time trying to get your shit together, because it’s all on auto pilot.**

At least, that’s what I hope, because as I just told you, I’ve never had a real routine before that I’ve stuck to!

This is my ideal routine. I don’t expect to actually nail all of these things, but, hey, shoot for the moon and you’ll land among the stars right?

### IDEAL ROUTINE

* Reading 1 hr/day
* Meditation 30 min/day
* Exercising consistently
    * Run 3 days/week
    * Start Weightlifting
    * Yoga weekly
* Eating healthy
    * It’s simple: focus on quality first
    * I want to eat a tomato that tastes like the color red. I want to focus on high-quality food. 
* Grooming routine
    * Skincare routine, hair care routine, flattering clothes
    * I want to leave the house feeling like a boss bitch every day (but in a natural, approachable way)
* Create for 1hr/day (anything I want!)
* Consistent bed time (this one is SO hard for me)
* Find ‘my people’ here in Seattle
    * Makers, dreamers, adventurers, people of Integrity, visionaries
* Plan ahead weekly and daily

I’m going to add in my routine one step at a time. For example, right now my current focus is furnishing my house. Before that, it was finding a place to live. Next up is taking a vacation. One focus at a time, so that I have plenty of space to sit still with myself.

Once I have a solid routine in place, then I can add travel and side projects back in, and have a good foundation for those things to rest upon.
