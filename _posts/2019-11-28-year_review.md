Hi, Madi Taskett here. You may know me from… wait, how do you know me again? What have I put into the world lately? Do you even remember why you started following me in the first place?

My biggest fear at the beginning of 2019 was becoming irrelevant. But sometimes you have plans for your year, and sometimes your year has plans for you. 2019 was the latter.

## WTF WAS 2019

You know your Uncle Bob, who got a heart attack at age 58 and he was completely shocked? **He kept repeating, “I’m so young, how could this happen to me?” and you just wanted to shake him and yell, “You eat fried chicken for breakfast and you haven’t exercised in 20 years! It’s obvious!”**

(Okay, you European readers, I get it- you all live balanced lifestyles and your uncle is healthy as a horse. Just stick with me here.)

In this situation, **I am Uncle Bob.** I started the year with a long list of things I wanted to ship, projects I wanted to collaborate on, places I wanted to visit… and what happened instead was I fell into a depression, only shipped [one thing all year](https://donewithlife.carrd.co/), had to stop traveling and return home because I was such a fucking mess, and went through the hardest breakup of my life.

But, just like Uncle Bob, these things didn’t suddenly just fall out of the sky. There were a lot of long-term issues that got me to such a low point.

### I struggle with anxiety

Earlier this year, I told the story of how I couldn’t lay on my bed and do nothing for even half an hour without [bursting into tears](https://madisontaskett.com/time-anxiety/), because it was so painful for me to not be productive.

And a couple months after starting therapy, something terrifying happened. **I was going on a sunny hike in the mountains on a lovely day, all alone when suddenly it felt like a bunch of dementors had surrounded me. This darkness swallowed me whole and I felt like I would never be happy again, and even worse, I realized that this awful feeling had been within me for as long as I could remember.** That night I didn’t sleep at all, I just layed alone, doing nothing, feeling the pain and despair consume me, and I worried that I was just fucked for life. Is it possible to overcome something that’s always there been there since you were a little kid?

_“This is a really good sign,”_ my therapist told me. _“Most people never get to this point. I was there too once. Just let yourself feel it. I promise, with time, it will get way better.”_

So I took her advice. I stopped the nomad life (for now) and got a home base in Seattle.

> “How do you like Seattle?” - my grandma

> “I like it. I got a lease!”

> “Oh? Like, month-to-month? Or like a 3 month lease?”

> “No, a year lease!”

> “A year? Are you feeling okay? Who are you? You’re not my grand daughter!” 😂😂😂😂😂

I have my own furniture and a lovely house that’s just mine, and I’m simultaneously thrilled about it and super scared. I can’t just run away to a tropical island and avoid my issues as easily as I could have before.

Now that I'm not distracting myself with constant travel, I find myself in more and more hours of stillness, and while it still is scary and awful, it’s nowhere near as bad as it was.

For that same reason, I’ve taken a really long break from any side hustles or related projects. **I’ll be able to create from a healthy place sometime in the future (same for traveling), but for now, working on those things is a way to medicate myself** so I can avoid working through the issues that got me to such a bad place to begin with.

### I struggle with codependency.

What is codependency? My favorite description of it is, _**Codependency is when you’re unable to tolerate the discomfort of others.**_ 

This usually stems from a dysfunctional childhood, and leads to a bunch of different [shitty behaviors](http://coda.org/index.cfm/meeting-materials1/patterns-of-recovery/). LOTS of people struggle with it, so I suggest looking through the shitty behaviors (of denial, low self esteem, compliance, and avoidance) and seeing if a good portion apply to you. You may be surprised.

I’ve known for a few years that I’ve had this, and I’ve done some personal work on it, but I didn’t know how deeply it affected every area of my life until my breakup in June. While it really sucked, it was a big wakeup call for me, and I started regularly seeing a therapist. 

Last month, I also started attending regular group meetings for codependency. There’s something about attending a 12-step meeting that scared the hell out of me. I thought only severely broken people did that sort of thing, and if I went, it was a public admission of, ‘Hi, I’m irreparably not good enough for life!’ My first meeting, I was shaking and trying not to cry. It took all my willpower to return a second week, where there was a new guy attending his first meeting. Guess what? He was shaking and trying not to cry, just like me the week before.

But going to the meetings every week has been SO freaking good for me. And the thing is, I’m not even convinced that it’s the actual content of the meetings that help so much. It’s the fact that, no matter what else is going on in my life, no matter how busy I am, no matter how I feel, I make my mental health my #1 priority and I demonstrate that every Tuesday at 7pm, rain or shine.

So that was 2019. Almost all of it sucked, a lot of it was a result of habits and coping mechanisms I’ve built up since I was a little kid, and it led to me not creating anything and basically becoming irrelevant.

## What’s in store for 2020

Irrelevancy used to be my biggest fear. But now that I’m here and completely irrelevant, I’m okay with it. If that’s what it’s going to take for me to be okay with myself, then hell yeah! Bring it on.

I have some big things I really want to accomplish next year. But right now I’m not in the place to produce again, and I don’t know when I’ll give myself the green light to make things in the future. 


So with that in mind, **I only have two definite _‘will happen’_ goals for 2020. They are:**

* Follow the Magic (and cut out anything that isn’t magical)
* Set solid, Consistent Routine/Habits

First off, when was the last time you took a real vacation? For me, it was March of 2018. So in January, I’m going to go somewhere really boring (Arizona wooo!) and I’m so psyched to sit by a pool, have meals with my family, and hike a ton of mountains in the sunshine and warm weather for a couple of weeks.

After that...

### Follow the Magic

Magic is quality. Magic is that feeling of wonder, of goosebumps, excitement, of YES.

Magic is something that just lights you up. It’s hard to define, but you undoubtedly know it when you feel it.

In 2020, I want to cut out anything that isn’t magic. I only want to hang out with people who feel a little bit like magic. I only want to buy or consume things that are magic. I only want to work on side projects that feel like magic. I only want to move my career in a direction that feels wondrous.


## Set solid, Consistent Routine/Habits


*Confession:* I’ve never stuck to a real routine. I don’t think my brain likes organization or consistency. But I also think it’s an ‘Uncle Bob’ symptom that has led to a lot of energy being spent unnecessarily. **A routine = all the healthy things in life are automated so that you don’t have to waste extra time trying to get your shit together, because it’s all on auto pilot.**

At least, that’s what I hope, because as I just told you, I’ve never had a real routine before that I’ve stuck to!

This is my ideal routine. I don’t expect to actually nail all of these things, but, hey, shoot for the moon and you’ll land among the stars right?

### IDEAL ROUTINE

* Reading 1 hr/day
* Meditation 30 min/day
* Exercising consistently
    * Run 3 days/week
    * Start Weightlifting
    * Yoga weekly
* Eating healthy
    * It’s simple: focus on quality first
    * I want to eat a tomato that tastes like the color red. I want to focus on high-quality food. 
* Grooming routine
    * Skincare routine, hair care routine, flattering clothes
    * I want to leave the house feeling like a boss bitch every day (but in a natural, approachable way)
* Create for 1hr/day (anything I want!)
* Consistent bed time (this one is SO hard for me)
* Find ‘my people’ here in Seattle
    * Makers, dreamers, adventurers, people of Integrity, visionaries
* Plan ahead weekly and daily

I’m going to add in my routine one step at a time. For example, right now my current focus is furnishing my house. Before that, it was finding a place to live. Next up is taking a vacation. One focus at a time, so that I have plenty of space to sit still with myself.

Once I have a solid routine in place, then I can add travel and side projects back in, and have a good foundation for those things to rest upon.
