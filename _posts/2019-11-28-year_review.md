Hi, Madi Taskett here. You may know me from… wait, how do you know me again? What have I put into the world lately? Do you even remember why you started following me in the first place?

My biggest fear at the beginning of 2019 was becoming irrelevant. But sometimes you have plans for your year, and sometimes your year has plans for you. 2019 was the latter.

## WTF WAS 2019

You know your Uncle Bob, who got a heart attack at age 58 and he was completely shocked? He kept repeating, “I’m so young, how could this happen to me?” and you just wanted to shake him and yell, “You eat fried chicken for breakfast and you haven’t exercised in 20 years! It’s obvious!”

(Okay, you European readers, I get it- you all live balanced lifestyles and your uncle is healthy as a horse. Just stick with me here.)

In this situation, I am Uncle Bob. I started the year with a long list of things I wanted to ship, projects I wanted to collaborate on, places I wanted to visit… and what happened instead was I fell into a depression, only shipped one thing all year (burnout quiz), had to stop traveling and return home because I was such a fucking mess, and went through the hardest breakup of my life.

But, just like Uncle Bob, these things didn’t suddenly just fall out of the sky. There were a lot of long-term issues that got me to such a low point.

### I have codependency.

What is codependency? My favorite description of it is, ‘Codependency is when you’re unable to tolerate the discomfort of others.’

This usually stems from a dysfunctional childhood, and leads to a bunch of different shitty behaviors.

I’ve known for a few years that I’ve had this, and I’ve done some personal work on it, but I didn’t know how deeply it affected every area of my life until my breakup in June. While it really sucked, it was a big wakeup call for me, and I started regularly seeing a therapist. 

Last month, I also started attending regular group meetings for codependency. There’s something about attending a 12-step meeting that scared the hell out of me. I thought only severely broken people did that sort of thing, and if I went, it was a public admission of, ‘Hi, I’m broken!’ My first meeting, I was shaking and trying not to cry. It took all my willpower to return a second week, where there was a new guy attending his first meeting. Guess what? He was shaking and trying not to cry, just like me the week before.

But going to the meetings every week has been SO freaking good for me. And the thing is, I’m not even convinced that it’s the actual content of the meetings that help so much. It’s the fact that, no matter what else is going on in my life, no matter how busy I am, no matter how I feel, I make my mental health my #1 priority and I demonstrate that every Tuesday at 7pm, rain or shine.

### I am a very anxious person.

Earlier this year, I told the story of how I couldn’t lay on my bed and do nothing for even half an hour without bursting into tears, it was so painful to not be productive.

And a couple months after starting therapy, something terrifying happened. I was going on a sunny hike in the mountains on a lovely day, all alone when suddenly it felt like a bunch of dementors had surrounded me. This darkness swallowed me whole and I felt like I would never be happy again, and even worse, I realized that this awful feeling had been within me for as long as I could remember. That night I didn’t sleep at all, I just layed alone, doing nothing, feeling the pain and despair consume me, and I worried that I was just fucked for life. Is it possible to overcome something that’s always there been there since you were a little kid?

“This is a really good sign,” my therapist told me. “Most people never get to this point. I was there too once. Just let yourself feel it. I promise, with time, it will get way better.”

So I took her advice. I stopped the nomad life (for now) and got a home base in Seattle.

> “How do you like Seattle?” my Grandma asked when I came to visit her in SF for a weekend.

> “I like it. I got a lease!”

> “Oh? Like, month-to-month? Or like a 3 month lease?”

> “No, a year lease!”

> “A year? Are you feeling okay? Who are you? You’re not my grand daughter!” 😂😂😂😂😂

I have my own furniture and a lovely house that’s just mine, and I’m simultaneously thrilled about it and super scared. Now, I can’t just run away to a tropical island and avoid my issues as easily as I could have before.

Already I’ve had time alone in my new home to have some hours of stillness, and while it still is scary and awful, it’s nowhere near as bad as it was.

For that same reason, I’ve taken a really long break from any side hustles or related projects. I’ll be able to create from a healthy place sometime in the future (same for traveling), but for now, working on those things is a way to medicate myself so I don’t have to be alone with my mind and work through the issues that got me to such a bad place to begin with.

So that was 2019. Almost all of it sucked, a lot of it was a result of habits and coping mechanisms I’ve built up since I was a little kid, and it led to me not creating anything and basically becoming irrelevant.

## What’s in store for 2020

Irrelevancy used to be my biggest fear. But now that I’m here and completely irrelevant, I’m okay with it. If that’s what it’s going to take for me to be okay with myself, then hell yeah! Bring it on.

I have some big things I really want to accomplish next year. But right now I’m not in the place to produce again, and I don’t know when I’ll give myself the green light to make things in the future. 


So with that in mind, I only have two definite ‘will happen’ goals for 2020. They are:

* Follow the Magic (and cut out anything that isn’t magical)
* Set solid, Consistent Routine/Habits

First off, when was the last time you took a real vacation? For me, it was March of 2018. So in January, I’m going to go somewhere really boring (Arizona wooo!) and I’m so psyched to sit by a pool, have meals with my family, and hike a ton of mountains in the sunshine and warm weather for a couple of weeks.

After that...

### Follow the Magic

Magic is quality. Magic is that feeling of wonder, of goosebumps, excitement, of YES.

Magic is something that just lights you up. It’s hard to define, but you undoubtedly know it when you feel it.

In 2020, I want to cut out anything that isn’t magic. I only want to hang out with people who feel a little bit like magic. I only want to buy or consume things that are magic. I only want to work on side projects that feel like magic. I only want to move my career in a direction that feels wondrous.
Set solid, Consistent Routine/Habits


*Confession:* I’ve never stuck to a real routine. I don’t think my brain likes organization or consistency. But I also think it’s an ‘Uncle Bob’ symptom that has led to a lot of energy being spent unnecessarily. A routine = all the healthy things in life are automated so that you don’t have to waste extra time trying to get your shit together, because it’s all on auto pilot.

At least, that’s what I hope, because as I just told you, I’ve never had a real routine before that I’ve stuck to!

This is my ideal routine. I don’t expect to actually nail all of these things, but, hey, shoot for the moon and you’ll land among the stars right?

### IDEAL ROUTINE

* Reading 1 hr/day
* Meditation 30 min/day
Exercising consistently
Run 3 days/week
Start Weightlifting
Yoga weekly
Eating healthy
It’s simple: focus on quality first
I want to eat a tomato that tastes like the color red. I want to focus on high-quality food. 
Grooming routine
Skincare routine, hair care routine, flattering clothes
I want to leave the house feeling like a boss bitch every day (but in a natural, approachable way)
Create for 1hr/day (anything I want!)
Consistent bed time (this one is SO hard for me)
Find ‘my people’ here in Seattle
Makers
Dreamers
Adventurers
People of Integrity
People who live consciously
Visionaries
Plan ahead weekly and daily

I’m going to add in my routine one step at a time. For example, right now my current focus is furnishing my house. Before that, it was finding a place to live. Next up is taking a vacation. One focus at a time, so that I have plenty of space to sit still with myself.

Once I have a solid routine in place, then I can add travel and side projects back in, and have a good foundation for those things to rest upon.






















-----------------
#### It’s March of this year and I’m lying on my bed in Oaxaca, Mexico, sobbing into the sheets while my then-boyfriend strokes my hair.

“I can’t do this!” I utter while catching my breath.

“It takes practice,” he said, “but you can’t keep on like this. You have to learn how to relax.”

[Anne Laure](https://nesslabs.com/time-anxiety) and [Pieter Levels](https://levels.io/enjoy-your-tea-and-a-cookie/) recently wrote about their experiences and interpretations of a concept called time anxiety.

**My definition of time anxiety is: the time in your life when you realize that you are mortal and life is short, and you respond by filling your time with as much meaning as possible.**

Everyone’s definition of ‘meaning’ is personal and varies from person to person. *I responded to time anxiety by becoming a maker.* What started as a beautiful exploration of creativity and community crossed the line into toxicity and depression. Here’s my story.

---

It began with a compliment from a best friend.

I had just poured my heart into a fun conference speech called, “Your Content Sucks.” To my surprise, it was the most attended event at the conference, even beating out Techstars founder Brad Feld. That talk instantly made me known in the Boulder startup scene and for the next week, strangers would stop me to thank me for such an insightful talk.

**_“You know what my favorite thing about you is?” my friend said after my speech. “You eat the Earth. You want to experience everything in this world while you’re here, and it’s beautiful.”_**

Suddenly, I felt like my life had the meaning I’d been searching for. I’d been saving 50% of my income for some time, so I quit my job and started launching products.

*Making was like a drug.* At first, I would get high making really quirky joyous things (dog deodorant, anyone?) And, to my amazement, dog deodorant actually sold!

#### I think that when you are making things that come from a place of unbridled heart and soul, others will feel that and respond to it. It had been the same way with my speech.

But time anxiety was not satisfied. Soon the high wore off and I wanted to eat MORE of the Earth, to not only have a business but travel the world while I was doing it. So I shuttered my physical product, and went to Asia.

At first, my making was solely about self-expression. I would work 16 hour days for a month straight to make a full-photographed street food cookbook on the streets of Bangkok. I would make street food maps and write extensively about my travels.

**The highs I got from producing without end kept the creeping burnout under the surface.** If I stopped and stood still for long enough, the darkness would creep up, and that nagging thought that, “I won’t be enough if I stop creating” would come racing back.

_Note: this time anxiety affected almost everything in my life, from the need to constantly travel the world, to placing unhealthy expectations on myself and those around me, to being a maker._

I started gaining a community around the work I was creating. I found myself surrounded by fascinating, driven, curious individuals who were creating things that mattered. It was wondrous and terrifying all at once. 

#### “If you take a break now,” the time anxiety would say, “then you’ll not only be a failure, but you’ll also become useless to your community. Stop making, and they stop caring.”

As I ticked ‘self-expression’ off of my life experience box, the urge to make money sprang to the surface. My community was using the things they made to make a living. I should try too!

I started focusing on money instead of creating from my soul. My community grew more as I attempted ambitious projects that looked promising. **But many of these projects never launched because slowly, the magic drained out of everything I did.** The maker drug had stopped getting me high so I used more than ever, staying awake working until 3 or 4 in the morning every day, dreading falling asleep because I knew that when I woke up, it would be with a pounding heart, a ceaseless feeling that I was never creating enough, worried sick that I would never live a life to my full potential.

Around this time, I met my then-boyfriend, a man who knew how to take breaks and relax. He saw that I was hurting myself by constantly producing even when the joy in doing so had long disappeared, and that if I kept this up, I would not just eat a bit of the Earth but consume the whole damn planet until there was nothing solid left for me to stabilize myself on.

#### Thus we find ourselves in that bedroom in Oaxaca in March. 

I’ve tried to relax and it feels like going on withdrawals from a drug. I shake, I cry, I get angry. I can’t do it. 

So he puts me on metaphorical methadone for productivity. We start experimenting with ways I can feel productive without actually using my brain. During this time, I play so much Pokemon that it’s slightly embarrassing. He makes me take cuddle breaks in between work meetings. We go for long walks around the park each day after work and lay on the grass, staring at the sky, doing nothing.

---

I wish I could tell you that the story ends there, that he taught me how to let go of my unceasing quest for perfection and we lived happily ever after.

But I had a real problem and I wasn’t taking responsibility for getting help. I kept working in my spare time. I denied that anything was seriously wrong with me. Time anxiety was a key part of my identity. Letting go of it meant relearning how I define my worth, potentially losing my friendship network, and possibly letting my life pass me by.

#### What I didn't see was that I'd built up an identity around experiencing the entirety of life that, in the end, cost me many of the things I cared about most.

I lost my peace of mind, the person I loved, the ability to create from the heart, being in the moment, experiencing wonder. Time anxiety brought me all those things, then just as quickly took them all away.

**Now, as he warned me, I’ve eaten the entire Earth, and there’s nothing solid for me to stand upon any longer.** There is nothing left to consume but a speck of stardust, somewhere just outside my reach; close enough to grasp at, but far enough away that I will never, ever be able to touch it.

#### But I still stretch out my arm as far as I can. Maybe, _just maybe…_

_PS: I stopped traveling and started seeing a therapist regularly and things are getting better. I still feel the urge to make every single day. But I’ve managed to act on that urge only about 20% of the time, versus 95% of the time before making these changes. My goal is to stop creating completely until I know I’m creating things from my heart (and this post fits that criteria) I still feel like I’m losing my identity and my community, but I will continue to lose much more if I don't stop now._
