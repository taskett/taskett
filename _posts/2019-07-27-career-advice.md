Remember, you love your people. Let it show. Help them.

The other night, I met up with a successful friend who started his own funded company.

He gave me a lot of really great advice, and I want to share it with you too.

## My Founder Friend's best tips for success

#### How to Move up in a Company

* **I don’t know a single person who made it to the top without being pulled up by someone else.**

* Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Plant seeds all over the company. Seek out the superstars and get to know them.

* Take a step back and view the entire company. Who are the key players? Do they know who you are?

* What can you work on that Senior Leadership will notice? Focus on those projects. Ask someone senior to groom your projects for those that are most impactful.

* Focus on being highly visible. Work on high-visibility projects, even better if you own/run those projects.

* Go the extra mile to stand out and make people think of you first: like sending a co-worker a baby present.

#### What to do when you feel Blocked

* **When you are feeling blocked in your projects, this is almost always a sign to take a step back and invest in yourself.** This could be listening to business podcasts or by talking to new people at the company or starting a different kind of project. But when you’re blocked at work it’s always a sign to work on yourself. 

* If your specific team or manager is a dud, do what you have to, please the people you have to please, and then make all your other projects about making it outside of your team.

* No matter how bad your job or your situation is, there is always an opportunity to do something in that company. Always an opportunity to shine and make a difference. Always!

* Is there something leadership does that you admire? You don’t need a title to act like that.

#### Mental Health and Work

* Don’t take your job too seriously.

* Act like a man and assume it’s someone else’s fault. Don’t blame everything on yourself.

* Know what to care about and what not to give a shit about.

#### Entrepreneurship

* When you start a company, the #1 thing is to find something you are passionate about. Because it’s going to get really hard and you are going to need that to keep you going.

* Don’t know what to start a business doing? Start by making a list of things that you like.

* And make deadlines. If you want to come up with an idea, make sure you have a due date.
