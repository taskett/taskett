    "title": "My Successful Founder Friend dishes his best Career Advice",
    "body": "2019/08/01 - I grabbed a bite to eat the other week with one of my favorite coworkers, Shafiq Shivji, who is a former startup founder. We discussed the best way to gain traction and move up at a company, what to do when you‚Äôre feeling stuck at work, and the most important thing to have when you start your own business. I fervently took notes, and now I‚Äôm sharing his best career advice with you. Shafiq‚Äôs best tips for success: Visibility is Everything:    Look for opportunities to be highly visible. Work on high-visibility projects (whether this is at your job or if you‚Äôre doing personal branding or a side hustle), even better if you own/run those projects. You want people to know what you are capable of.     Take a step back and look at the key players in your industry who could impact your success the most. Who are they? Do they know who you are?     I don‚Äôt know a single person who made it to the top without being pulled up by someone else.     Don‚Äôt put all your eggs in one basket. Plant seeds in many different places, and with many different people. Seek out the superstars and get to know them.     If you‚Äôre at a company, what can you work on that senior brass will notice? Focus on those projects.     On that note, at least once a quarter, ask someone senior to groom your projects for those that are most impactful.  What to do when you feel Blocked:    When you are feeling blocked in your projects, this is almost always a sign to take a step back and invest in yourself. This could be listening to business podcasts or by talking to new people in your industry, starting a different kind of project, or simply walking away for a bit. But when you‚Äôre blocked at work it‚Äôs always a sign to work on yourself first.     At a company, don‚Äôt let a dud team or manager stop you from progressing, do what you have to, align yourself with other people who can open doors, and invest your energies in making it in spite of your blockers.     If you have your own venture, focus on what works; spend more time maximizing what is already working and pull your attention away from initiatives that aren‚Äôt bringing you ROI.     No matter how bad your job or your situation is, there is always an opportunity to do something good in that company. Always an opportunity to shine and make a difference. Always!     Is there something leadership does that you admire? You don‚Äôt need a title to act like that.  Mental Health and Work:    Don‚Äôt take your job too seriously! Heck, don‚Äôt take anything in life too seriously.     If you‚Äôre hard on yourself, try assuming it‚Äôs not your fault. Seriously, if you‚Äôre stressed about something that‚Äôs not going perfectly at work, assume it‚Äôs someone or something else‚Äôs that‚Äôs a blocker, and move forward. Don‚Äôt sweat it. Don‚Äôt blame everything on yourself.     Know what to care about and what not to give a shit about. Even if you have investors or customers or bosses pestering you to get certain things done, if it‚Äôs not high-impact, don‚Äôt treat it like it is. And when you have a high-impact initiative, make it your #1 priority. Do this long enough and you‚Äôll watch your career transform.  Starting a Company:    When you start a company, the #1 thing is to find something you are passionate about. Because it‚Äôs going to get really hard, and things are going to get bleak at many points, and you are going to need that to keep you going.     Don‚Äôt know what to start a business doing? Start by making a list of things that you like! Search for that passion.     And make deadlines. If you want to come up with an idea, make sure you have a due date. I‚Äôll give myself a due date for a problem that I have no idea how to solve, and every single time, my brain comes up with a solution by the deadline.  In the two weeks since our chat, I‚Äôve started implementing some of Shafiq‚Äôs advice and I‚Äôve already seen an improvement in how effective I am at my job (and I‚Äôm enjoying my work more too!) If you thought this was helpful and you‚Äôd like me to hound more of my successful founder friends for their best advice, leave a comment or tweet me. "

    "title": "How Nomadism Contributes to Burnout and What to do about It",
    "body": "2019/07/20 - Over the past year, I‚Äôve seen a burnout epidemic among digital nomads.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been pretty tired for some time now‚Äù  ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been going through this cycle of being burned out, getting a bit better, and then falling back into it again. ‚Äù  ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt focus and I don‚Äôt know what to do about it‚Äù I‚Äôm also a nomad who has been struggling with burnout for the past year. Since last November, I haven‚Äôt written a single article. In fact, this website was down for over 8 months and I didn‚Äôt have the energy to fix it until this week. Only now am I starting to function normally again. So how do I have the energy to fix my site and start writing again? I took a break from long-term travel and went home for a while. Turns out, there‚Äôs a neurological explanation for why going home helped me so much, and I‚Äôll cover it here. How Serial Travel Affects Our Awareness: According to the book, The Mind Illuminated, our conscious experience consists of two areas: attention and peripheral awareness. Attention hones in on specific things, either in our minds or outside of us, so we can analyze and interpret them. At the same time we can also be aware of what‚Äôs going on around us and in the background, which is our peripheral awareness. Peripheral awareness gives us a bigger context of issues so we can respond better to life‚Äôs events. Attention is under our direct control, but our peripheral awareness is not. When we‚Äôre in a healthy state of mind, attention and peripheral awareness work together to make sure we‚Äôre always mindful of the situations we are in, and that we‚Äôre responding to them effectively. However, when we travel for long periods of time, this balance can get thrown off and can cause a negative feedback loop which traps us in ever increasing states of burnout. This is based on a concept called awareness deficit disorder. When we travel to foreign places, our peripheral awareness gets bombarded by new sights, smells, languages, weather conditions, geographical points, and more.  Even a simple trip to the grocery store introduces us to thousands of new stimuli, many of which we may have never encountered before in our lives. Remember from earlier that while we can control what we pay attention to, we don‚Äôt have direct control over what appears in our peripheral awareness. This causes us to overuse our attention because it is what‚Äôs under our direct control. We try to take everything in, to process and make sense of it all, and it overwhelms us. This can cause a downward spiral where we become less aware of situations because we overuse our attention, but to compensate, we use our attention even more, thus utilizing our peripheral awareness less, diminishing situational awareness even further. Basically, when we try to pay attention to too many stimuli on a constant basis over a long period of time, it breaks our brains.  Another situation where we lose our ability to be mindful is whenever our attention shifts rapidly back and forth between different objects. It takes considerable brain power to attend to a bunch of different stimuli at once. There are three kinds of these distractions::    Scanning: is when our mind scans our inner and outer surroundings for something of interest. While traveling, our mind is constantly scanning our surroundings for something new and exciting, or for foreign dangers we should avoid.     Getting captured: this is when an outer or inner distraction, from an ambulance passing to a body spasm to a strange thought, disrupts our attention. This could happen from the joyful discovery that the garbage trucks in Taipei play classical music, to almost getting hit by an errant motorcycle driving on the sidewalk.     Alternating: When you ‚Äòmultitask‚Äô and you think you‚Äôre doing two things at once, really your attention is just rapidly alternating from one thing to the other, but you think you are maintaining focus on both things. An example is talking to a friend while looking for a cafe while simultaneously avoiding huge cracks in the sidewalk somewhere like Canggu.  When we travel, traffic might come from the other side of the road, or we might be in a touristy area where hagglers are competing for our attention, or we could be somewhere unknown where we‚Äôre on extra guard for our safety. All of these factors drain us, and over time they add a friction to daily living that wears us down and depletes our capacity to function at optimal levels.  Emotional stress caused by travel also causes the same thing to happen, as we have so many internal worries and concerns that we lose the ability to step back and see the bigger picture. When one takes into account all of these factors, it‚Äôs obvious that nomadism can contribute to chronic burnout. How Successful Nomads Avoid Burnout: A nomadic lifestyle doesn‚Äôt have to be unhealthy. Plenty of people are able to sustain a nomadic lifestyle over the long term while also maintaining their sanity. So how do they do it? They add as much stability as possible to their living situations. They Slowmad: You may be familiar with the concept of slowmading, where one stays in locations for 2-3 months or longer. Most nomads transition to this style of living after the first year or two of going nomadic. Keeping a stable routine will give one‚Äôs brain a sense of stability and normalcy, and could help one recover from burnout quicker, and also help prevent travel-caused burnout in the first place. They Visit Home or they Have a Home Base: Many nomads visit home or they have a determined home base that they return to year after year. Returning home, whether it‚Äôs a childhood home in or one that‚Äôs self-created, creates a familiarity that can put one‚Äôs brain on autopilot and free up space to focus again. In fact, I‚Äôm looking for a home base myself. If you have suggestions, tweet me! They Visit the Same Places Every Year: Some nomads don‚Äôt have one select home base, but instead live in multiple places and visit the same 2+ places every year. Traveling to the same places over and over stops overwhelming the brain with new stimuli. These places start to feel more like home than new destinations. They Travel to places with low Friction of Daily Living: Auth0 (my employer)‚Äôs CEO was hosting an AMA when an Argentinian employee asked him what he missed most about his home country of Argentina. He paused and then said,  ‚ÄúWhile I will always love my country, my honest answer is that I do not miss it. There was a friction to daily living that hindered my ability to use my brain to its fullest capacity. ‚Äù He then spoke about the political strife and danger growing up in Buenos Aires, and how even after things calmed down, there was a difficulty to doing basic daily tasks in that country that took up a lot of his brain space. When he moved to the USA that friction went away, and he was able to succeed at Microsoft and, later on, was able to found Auth0. (Note: He left Buenos Aires many years ago and it has since become a much more lovely place to live. ) Living in a place that is safe, clean, and peaceful allows the mind to relax, enabling it to focus on solving bigger issues and make a mark on this world. If you‚Äôre looking for a country to relax in, here‚Äôs a map of the safest countries in the world.  They Meditate: Remember how it‚Äôs possible to control attention but not peripheral awareness? Meditation trains the brain to utilize peripheral awareness as well as attention! This allows a more holistic view of life‚Äôs issues. This ability to selectively focus on what matters and tune out distractions means that travel could overwhelm a skilled meditator less than someone who does not meditate. They Keep a Stable Routine: Hannah is right. Keeping a rythm or routine that you can keep the same, no matter where you are, is a great way of helping your brain know what to expect day in and day out, no matter what else is going on in your life. Burnout Solved: While there are many factors that lead to burnout, a constantly-changing nomadic lifestyle is a larger contributor. Going home, slowing down one‚Äôs travel, meditation, and choosing familiar travel spots can all help prevent or ameliorate burnout. As for me, I‚Äôm back home and don‚Äôt see myself hopping back on the road for at least another few months. Every day that I surround myself with the same boring, easy environment, my brain fog lifts a little more. I‚Äôm trading the excitement of seeing the world and meeting fascinating new people for the adventure of exploring my own mind and picking projects that spark a fire in my soul. It‚Äôs a worthy trade-off. "

    "title": "Bali was Weird, the People Sucked, and Maybe I Sucked Too",
    "body": "2019/07/20 - I‚Äôm gonna be real with you. Bali has been weird. : Where do I begin?¬†So I broke my trip into two parts: two weeks in Ubud and two in Canggu. I wanted to see what each was about, and my boyfriend‚Äôs Balinese friend Kera* (named changed) really wanted to host me in Ubud. Ubud is first up. : Kera‚Äôs homestay is out in the countryside, and every morning I¬† wake up and walk out onto my terrace to see nothing but rice paddies with palm tree forests in the background, the breeze in my hair, the sun shining, feeling like I‚Äôve actually found paradise. Unreal. {PICTURE} Every morning, no matter which ungodly hour I wake up at, Kera‚Äôs husband makes me a hot breakfast. He‚Äôs a perfect little house-husband, cutting tropical fruits into complex designs that my clumsy ass would never be able to pull off. After breakfast, I go out to lunch and the locals ask to take photos with me. I end up taking more pictures with strangers in my two weeks in Ubud than in my entire first year of travel. {PICTURE} I go for daily runs along the rice fields at sunset and everyone turns and smiles and talks to me. Every time I come home, everyone in the family stops what they‚Äôre doing to acknowledge my presence. If I want tea? Kera‚Äôs sister, who has a leg deformity and uses a crutch, climbs the stairs and makes it for me, not allowing me to do it myself. ¬†People on the streets introduce themselves, including a mystical old man who invites me to his jungle temple (it is ridiculously cool), introduces me to his wife (pictured below) and says I‚Äôm welcome to visit them any time. {PICTURE}{PICTURE} After a few days of this, of waking up whenever I want, having hot meals made on demand by the house-husband, and watching farmers out slashing rice in the fields, I begin to feel uncomfortable. It dawns on me that because I come from a rich country, I can stay in the nice room with the view and the marble floors while the rest of the family shares one bed with no door on their room. Because I‚Äôm white, everyone wants pictures with me. Because I grew up with enough money, I don‚Äôt have to know how to count it like I was born holding it. My last day in Ubud, Kera asks for 378,000 IDR and I slowly, painstakingly count it out before she takes it and counts it in 2 seconds, her hands moving like the money is a mere extension of her arm. Speaking of Kera. My boyfriend sets me up with her homestay, saying that she‚Äôs a ton of fun and full of intriguing conversation and crazy stories. Saying that‚Äôs she‚Äôs a real hustler who charges rich people $100 each for rice paddy tours. Saying that she‚Äôs trapped in an arranged marriage where her husband‚Äôs entire family has to live with her, that he dampened her dreams, doesn‚Äôt support her ambition, and is keeping her from living her fullest life. Kera is a woman who longs for more, but since she‚Äôs Balinese, she is stuck with the life that‚Äôs been given her. : And in walks me. I don‚Äôt even know how to count money right. I am languid, and I wake up late, and I have no idea how lucky I am. And the tall, funny, blue eyed Swedish man she has a crush on had the gall to send me to her homestay, telling her that I was something special and to take good care of me. I am a lazy new-age colonialist who has Kera‚Äôs man, Kera‚Äôs money, Kera‚Äôs freedom‚Ä¶ basically Kera‚Äôs life, had she not been born in Bali. : It‚Äôs night, and they‚Äôre burning the rice fields in front of me and the air is thick with smoke and flame. ¬†In the nearby jungle the locals are playing super eery traditional Balinese music which sounds like it was created in Mordor and was created to summon Sauron. Kera lights a mosquito coil, sits across from me, and tells me all sorts of lies about how my boyfriend is returning in September to open a co-working space, and he‚Äôs going to stay in the area for a long time, and didn‚Äôt he tell me? And I look into her eyes, full of spice and ambition and fire and anger, and I both deeply respect and pity her at the same time. The next day I go on my evening solo-jog. I run past a bunch of the kids playing- they‚Äôre always in a group laughing and making up adventures together. Kera is never alone either, she‚Äôs always chatting with her friends, family, or other neighbors. In fact, I never see Balinese people by themselves, as it seems like everyone in this village sticks together. On my run, I see her husband running errands. As usual, he‚Äôs smiling. As usual, he‚Äôs with their 3 year old son- he‚Äôs always with at least one of the kids. I look at his face and realize that he‚Äôs quite handsome, and I think about the fact that Kera lives in the country, is surrounded by nature all the time, and has family to help her with the household chores. How her kids are growing up outdoors with a community that loves and cares for them. And how her husband always does everything with love (I always knew when Kera made breakfast because it looked like a mess compared to his meals), and how he was the perfect stay-at-home dad to her career-woman ways. And I notice that he has her in his phone as ‚Äúlover. ‚Äù I mention this to my boyfriend. ‚ÄúWow,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI had no idea he loved her. She definitely doesn‚Äôt love him. ‚Äù I wonder if it‚Äôs because they‚Äôre poorly matched, or simply because she didn‚Äôt have a choice in the matter. I wonder if she had the ability to chose him, him being a handsome, caring, good person, would she love him then? If it hadn‚Äôt been forced upon her, would she be happy with the life she has? So with all that jumbled in my brain, two weeks after arriving I get in a cab and come to Berawa. : It‚Äôs like stepping into the world Kera dreams of at night. Everyone looks like the direct descendants of a God. Six pack abs aren‚Äôt even impressive here. Every man has golden skin and hair that shines like justice, with a smile that puts the sun to shame. Every woman is half naked with a body that would make even a stripper cry, and she walks like she‚Äôs never had an insecure thought in her entire life. The sun shines bright over the crashing waves. Walking along the beach at sunset, once again, I think I‚Äôve actually found paradise. {PICTURE} I go out to breakfast the next day and see they serve a√ßa√≠ bowls, so I order one and of course it‚Äôs not genuine acai (I‚Äôve never had real a√ßa√≠ outside of Brazil; they always mix in other fruits). This one isn‚Äôt even the right color (it‚Äôs hot pink instead of a deep purple), but it‚Äôs beautiful and covered in edible flowers and surely none of their European customers know the difference anyway. But I know the difference. It‚Äôs beautiful, and it‚Äôs delicious, but it‚Äôs not real. I can‚Äôt help but think about that over the next week. Every day I go to a new restaurant and get their acai bowl. Every day I sit at a table overlooking some stunning view, decorated in the most ‚Äúin‚Äù style imaginable (I don‚Äôt know who does the interior decor for all the restaurants here in Bali but it looks like Instagram on steroids). Every day, the bowl I receive is breathtakingly beautiful in a new, different way. {picture} {picture} And every day, the a√ßa√≠ isn‚Äôt a√ßa√≠. The next day I‚Äôm eating an ‚Äúa√ßa√≠‚Äù bowl (this one tastes exactly like the mixed berry blend from Costco) when a handsome silver-fox asks to borrow my charger. I turn to gaze into a pair of ocean-blue eyes and a perfectly veneered, if slightly icy, smile. Meet Asshole Steve. : Asshole Steve IS Kera in another life. He‚Äôs a hustler who 10 years ago decided that he wanted to move to Bali, so he started a villa-leasing company which now (according to him) makes 30k/month and competes with Booking. com. He has completely designed every aspect of his life according to his wishes, he a bangs a new exotic woman every week, and he spends his days in coffee shops and surfing in the ocean. No wife or family or home-culture to weigh him down. Asshole Steve is living the dream.  ‚ÄúAre you sipping on that tea because you‚Äôre too cheap to buy another drink?‚Äù He asks. I laugh and admit that it‚Äôs true.  ‚ÄúOrder anything you‚Äôd like. Waiter, can we get her another drink?‚Äù He orders for me. He offers to give me business advice and so we start talking about marketing strategies when everything starts to unravel. He tells me, get this, that the room-sharing business I‚Äôm building is doomed to fail, that my relationship is doomed to fail simply because he‚Äôs Swedish, and that no matter what I build, it will end up trapping me in the end. He goes on to tell me that now that he‚Äôs built a business here, he can‚Äôt escape. Tells me that his girlfriend of 15 years left him 8 months ago and he‚Äôs still picking up the pieces. Next thing I know he‚Äôs on Tinder swiping through all the 20 year olds he could go home with that night and as he looks me in the face I realize that a) he wishes I was one of those swipes and b) he‚Äôs just as lost and miserable as Kera is, even though he has the exact life she dreams of. He gets up, offers me a copywriting job ‚Äúfor a real expert‚Äù but offering a total beginner‚Äôs rate, and leaves without buying the drink he ordered for me. As I said, a total asshole. That night, I dream that I am asshole Steve. ¬†I‚Äôm older, and all of my dreams have come true. I sit on some exotic beach sipping Pi√±a Coladas, wearing designer clothes, dishing with my friends about my latest plastic surgery while wearing designer clothes from head to toe. I am filthy rich, I travel full-time, and I get anything that I want. And then I take a closer look at my friends and jump back in horror. They are merely cardboard cut-outs with laugh tracks. The beach around me is deserted. I am completely alone in the world, childless and old, with no family, no husband, and no one real in my life. I awake with a start, and go¬†to a spot called Ruko Cafe. I order their a√ßa√≠ bowl. It comes to my table and I dig my spoon in and by God‚Ä¶ is this really happening? It‚Äôs the right color. I taste it. It‚Äôs the real thing. I, Madison Taskett, have found verdadeiro a√ßa√≠ outside of Brazil! I turn to tell someone, when I realize there is no one to tell. {PICTURE} I have no clue who anyone in this cafe is. Hell, I barely have any idea who anyone in this country is. I go out to dinner. ‚ÄúTable‚Ä¶ for one?‚Äù The waitress asks with pity. I nod and sit next to a table of utterly perfect looking white girls and listen as they casually dish about their nose jobs while the local Indonesians serve them more vegan food and cocktails. Afterward I walk to the beach to get some fresh air. It‚Äôs a full moon and there‚Äôs supposed to be a bunch of cool events going on by the ocean. I arrive to find the beach empty. There are only nightclubs, and I look in and see people sitting at tables with their friends and lovers, laughing and enjoying each other‚Äôs company. No place for a ‚Äútable for one‚Äù like me. I go home to my empty hotel room, defeated, and¬†think back on the kind family that greeted me when I got home every day in Ubud. About the sweet house-husband who would cut my fruit into perfect stars and took care of the kids. About a tight knit community that is always there for each each other. About the life I could have had, if only I was Kera. : "
