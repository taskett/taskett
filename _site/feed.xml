        <title>How Nomadism Contributes to Burnout and What to do about It</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the past year, I’ve seen a burnout epidemic among digital nomads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“I’ve been pretty tired for some time now”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“I’ve been going through this cycle of being burned out, getting a bit better, and then falling back into it again.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“I can’t focus and I don’t know what to do about it”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m also a nomad who has been struggling with burnout for the past year. Since last November, I haven’t written a single article. In fact, this website was down for over 8 months and I didn’t have the energy to fix it until this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only now am I starting to function normally again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how do I have the energy to fix my site and start writing again? &lt;strong&gt;I took a break from long-term travel and went home for a while.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out, there’s a neurological explanation for why going home helped me so much, and I’ll cover it here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-serial-travel-affects-our-awareness&quot;&gt;How Serial Travel Affects Our Awareness&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the book, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Mind-Illuminated-Meditation-Integrating-Mindfulness-ebook/dp/B01INMZKAQ/&quot;&gt;The Mind Illuminated&lt;/a&gt;, our conscious experience consists of two areas: &lt;strong&gt;attention and peripheral awareness.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attention hones in on specific things, either in our minds or outside of us, so we can analyze and interpret them. At the same time we can also be aware of what’s going on around us and in the background, which is our peripheral awareness. Peripheral awareness gives us a bigger context of issues so we can respond better to life’s events. &lt;strong&gt;Attention is under our direct control, but our peripheral awareness is not.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we’re in a healthy state of mind, attention and peripheral awareness work together to make sure we’re always mindful of the situations we are in, and that we’re responding to them effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;However, when we travel for long periods of time, this balance can get thrown off&lt;/strong&gt; and can cause a negative feedback loop which traps us in ever increasing states of burnout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is based on a concept called &lt;strong&gt;awareness deficit disorder.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we travel to foreign places, our peripheral awareness gets bombarded by new sights, smells, languages, weather conditions, geographical points, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Even a simple trip to the grocery store introduces us to thousands of new stimuli, many of which we may have never encountered before in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember from earlier that while we can control what we pay attention to, we don’t have direct control over what appears in our peripheral awareness. This causes us to overuse our attention because it is what’s under our direct control. We try to take everything in, to process and make sense of it all, and it overwhelms us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can cause a downward spiral where we become less aware of situations because we overuse our attention, but to compensate, we use our attention even more, thus utilizing our peripheral awareness less, diminishing situational awareness even further. &lt;strong&gt;Basically, when we try to pay attention to too many stimuli on a constant basis over a long period of time, it breaks our brains.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/nomad_burnout_cycle.png&quot; alt=&quot;Nomad Burnout Cycle&quot; title=&quot;Nomad Burnout Cycle&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another situation where we lose our ability to be mindful is whenever our attention shifts rapidly back and forth between different objects. It takes considerable brain power to attend to a bunch of different stimuli at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;there-are-three-kinds-of-these-distractions&quot;&gt;There are three kinds of these distractions:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scanning:&lt;/strong&gt; is when our mind scans our inner and outer surroundings for something of interest. While traveling, our mind is constantly scanning our surroundings for something new and exciting, or for foreign dangers we should avoid.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting captured:&lt;/strong&gt; this is when an outer or inner distraction, from an ambulance passing to a body spasm to a strange thought, disrupts our attention. This could happen from the joyful discovery that the garbage trucks in Taipei play classical music, to almost getting hit by an errant motorcycle driving on the sidewalk.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alternating:&lt;/strong&gt; When you ‘multitask’ and you think you’re doing two things at once, really your attention is just rapidly alternating from one thing to the other, but you think you are maintaining focus on both things. An example is talking to a friend while looking for a cafe while simultaneously avoiding huge cracks in the sidewalk somewhere like Canggu.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we travel, traffic might come from the other side of the road, or we might be in a touristy area where hagglers are competing for our attention, or we could be somewhere unknown where we’re on extra guard for our safety. All of these factors drain us, and over time they add &lt;strong&gt;a friction to daily living that wears us down and depletes our capacity to function at optimal levels.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/jumbotron.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Travel Chaos&quot; title=&quot;Travel Chaos&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emotional stress caused by travel also causes the same thing to happen, as we have so many internal worries and concerns that we lose the ability to step back and see the bigger picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When one takes into account all of these factors, it’s obvious that nomadism can contribute to chronic burnout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-successful-nomads-avoid-burnout&quot;&gt;How Successful Nomads Avoid Burnout&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A nomadic lifestyle doesn’t have to be unhealthy. Plenty of people are able to sustain a nomadic lifestyle over the long term while also maintaining their sanity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how do they do it? They &lt;strong&gt;add as much stability as possible to their living situations.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;they-slowmad&quot;&gt;They Slowmad&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may be familiar with the concept of slowmading, where one stays in locations for 2-3 months or longer. Most nomads transition to this style of living after the first year or two of going nomadic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keeping a stable routine will give one’s brain a sense of stability and normalcy, and could help one recover from burnout quicker, and also help prevent travel-caused burnout in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;they-visit-home-or-they-have-a-home-base&quot;&gt;They Visit Home or they Have a Home Base&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many nomads visit home or they have a determined home base that they return to year after year. Returning home, whether it’s a childhood home in or one that’s self-created, creates a familiarity that can put one’s brain on autopilot and free up space to focus again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, I’m looking for a home base myself. If you have suggestions, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/taskett&quot;&gt;tweet me!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;they-visit-the-same-places-every-year&quot;&gt;They Visit the Same Places Every Year&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/levelsio_tweet.png&quot; alt=&quot;@levelsio tweet&quot; title=&quot;@levelsio tweet&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some nomads don’t have one select home base, but instead live in multiple places and visit the same 2+ places every year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traveling to the same places over and over stops overwhelming the brain with new stimuli. These places start to feel more like home than new destinations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;they-travel-to-places-with-low-friction-of-daily-living&quot;&gt;They Travel to places with low Friction of Daily Living&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Auth0 (my employer)’s CEO was hosting an AMA when an Argentinian employee asked him what he missed most about his home country of Argentina. He paused and then said,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“While I will always love my country, my honest answer is that I do not miss it. There was a friction to daily living that hindered my ability to use my brain to its fullest capacity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He then spoke about the political strife and danger growing up in Buenos Aires, and how even after things calmed down, there was a difficulty to doing basic daily tasks in that country that took up a lot of his brain space. When he moved to the USA that friction went away, and he was able to succeed at Microsoft and, later on, was able to found Auth0. (Note: He left Buenos Aires many years ago and it has since become a much more lovely place to live.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Living in a place that is safe, clean, and peaceful allows the mind to relax, enabling it to focus on solving bigger issues and make a mark on this world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for a country to relax in, here’s a &lt;a href=&quot;https://drum-cussac.com/blog/world-risk-map/&quot;&gt;map of the safest countries in the world.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/world_safety_map2019.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;World Safety Map&quot; title=&quot;World Safety Map&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;they-meditate&quot;&gt;They Meditate&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember how it’s possible to control attention but not peripheral awareness? Meditation trains the brain to utilize peripheral awareness as well as attention! This allows a more holistic view of life’s issues. This ability to selectively focus on what matters and tune out distractions means that travel could overwhelm a skilled meditator less than someone who does not meditate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;they-keep-a-stable-routine&quot;&gt;They Keep a Stable Routine&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/herlifeinpixels.png&quot; alt=&quot;Hannah on Twitter&quot; title=&quot;Hannah on Twitter&quot; /&gt;
Hannah is right. Keeping a rythm or routine that you can keep the same, no matter where you are, is a great way of helping your brain know what to expect day in and day out, no matter what else is going on in your life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;burnout-solved&quot;&gt;Burnout Solved&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there are many factors that lead to burnout, a constantly-changing nomadic lifestyle is a larger contributor. Going home, slowing down one’s travel, meditation, and choosing familiar travel spots can all help prevent or ameliorate burnout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for me, I’m back home and don’t see myself hopping back on the road for at least another few months. Every day that I surround myself with the same boring, easy environment, my brain fog lifts a little more. I’m trading the excitement of seeing the world and meeting fascinating new people for the adventure of exploring my own mind and picking projects that spark a fire in my soul.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a worthy trade-off.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>My Successful Founder Friend dishes his best Career Advice</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I grabbed a bite to eat last week with one of my favorite coworkers, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/shafiqshivji/&quot;&gt;Shafiq Shivji&lt;/a&gt;, who is a former VC-backed startup founder. We discussed the best way to gain traction and move up at a company, what to do when you’re feeling stuck at work, and the most important thing to have when you start your own business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feverently took notes, and now I’m sharing his best career advice with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;shafiqs-best-tips-for-success&quot;&gt;Shafiq’s best tips for success&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;visibility-is-everything&quot;&gt;Visibility is Everything&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Focus on being highly visible. Work on high-visibility projects (whether this is at your job or if you’re doing personal branding or a side hustle), even better if you own/run those projects. You want people to know what &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; are capable of.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Take a step back and look at the key players in your industry who could impact your success the most. Who are they? Do they know who you are?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I don’t know a single person who made it to the top without being pulled up by someone else.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Plant seeds in many different places, and with many different people. Seek out the superstars and get to know them.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re at a company, what can you work on that Senior Leadership will notice? Focus on those projects.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On that note, once a quarter, ask someone senior to groom your projects for those that are most impactful.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-to-do-when-you-feel-blocked&quot;&gt;What to do when you feel Blocked&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you are feeling blocked in your projects, this is almost always a sign to take a step back and invest in yourself.&lt;/strong&gt; This could be listening to business podcasts or by talking to new people in your industry or starting a different kind of project. But when you’re blocked at work it’s &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; a sign to work on yourself first.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At a company, if your specific team or manager is a dud, do what you have to, please the people you have to please, and then make all your other projects about making it outside of your team.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you have your own venture, focus on what works; spend more time maximizing what is already working and pull your attention away from iniatives that aren’t bringing you ROI.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No matter how bad your job or your situation is, there is always an opportunity to do something good in that company. Always an opportunity to shine and make a difference. Always!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Is there something leadership does that you admire? You don’t need a title to act like that.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;mental-health-and-work&quot;&gt;Mental Health and Work&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Don’t take your job too seriously! Heck, don’t take anything in life too seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re hard on yourself, try assuming it’s not your fault. Seriously, if you’re stressed about something that’s not going perfectly at work, assume it’s someone or something else’s fault, and move forward. Don’t sweat it. Don’t blame everything on yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Know what to care about and what not to give a shit about.&lt;/strong&gt; Even if you have investors or customers or bosses pestering you to get certain things done, if it’s not high-impact, don’t treat it like it is. And when you have a high-impact iniative, make it your #1 priority. Do this long enough and you’ll watch your career transform.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;starting-a-company&quot;&gt;Starting a Company&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you start a company, the #1 thing is to find something you are passionate about. Because it’s going to get really hard, and things are going to get really dark and bleak at some point, and you are going to need that to keep you going.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Don’t know what to start a business doing? Start by making a list of things that you like! Search for that passion.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And make deadlines. If you want to come up with an idea, make sure you have a due date. I’ll give myself a due date for a problem that I have &lt;em&gt;no idea&lt;/em&gt; how to solve, and every single time, my brain comes up with a solution by the deadline.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the two weeks since our chat, I’ve started implementing some of Shafiq’s advice and I’ve &lt;strong&gt;already seen an improvement&lt;/strong&gt; in how effective I am at my job (and I’m enjoying my job more too!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you Shafiq for your great advice! You can find &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/shafiqshivji/&quot;&gt;Shafiq here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you thought this was helpful and you’d like me to hound more of my successful founder friends for their best advice, leave a comment or &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/taskett&quot;&gt;tweet me.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;And make deadlines. If you want to come up with an idea, make sure you have a due date. I’ll give myself a due date for a problem that I have &lt;em&gt;no idea&lt;/em&gt; how to solve, and every single time, my brain comes up with a solution by the deadline.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the two weeks since our chat, I’ve started implementing some of Shafiq’s advice and I’ve &lt;strong&gt;already seen an improvement&lt;/strong&gt; in how effective I am at my job (and I’m enjoying my job more too!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you Shafiq for your great advice! You can find &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/shafiqshivji/&quot;&gt;Shafiq here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you thought this was helpful and you’d like me to hound more of my successful founder friends for their best advice, leave a comment or &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/taskett&quot;&gt;tweet me.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
